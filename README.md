Introduction
In today's digital age, the spread of fake news has become a significant issue. This project addresses the problem by developing a text classification model to distinguish between fake and real news articles. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to create a reliable tool for identifying misinformation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of news articles labeled as fake or real. It is crucial to have a balanced dataset with sufficient examples of both classes to train and evaluate the models effectively.

Usage
To use this project:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-article-classification.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the prompts to train and evaluate the models.

Results
The project evaluates the performance of several machine learning models, including Passive Aggressive Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree Classifier. It plots confusion matrices and compares the accuracy of each model to determine the best-performing one.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
